- [ ] **Monitor-Specific Layouts:**
    - Support different layouts on different monitors.

### 5. Configuration:

- [ ] **Configuration File:**
    - Design and implement a configuration file in a user-friendly format (e.g., TOML).
    - Allow users to customize keybindings, colors, and other settings.

### 6. Window Rules and Hooks:

- [ ] **Window Rules:**
    - Implement rules for specific window behaviors (e.g., always float certain applications).

- [ ] **Event Hooks:**
    - Provide hooks for executing user-defined scripts or actions on specific events (e.g., window creation).

### 7. Status Bar Integration:

- [ ] **Status Bar Communication:**
    - Integrate with a status bar (e.g., polybar, lemonbar) for displaying workspace information and other details.

### 8. Floating Windows:

- [ ] **Floating Layout:**
    - Add support for floating windows.
    - Allow users to toggle between floating and tiled layouts for specific windows.

### 9. EWMH and ICCCM Compliance:

- [ ] **EWMH Support:**
    - Ensure compliance with the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification.

- [ ] **ICCCM Compliance:**
    - Adhere to the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM).

### 10. Mouse Resizing and Moving:

- [ ] **Mouse Resizing:**
    - Implement mouse-based resizing of windows.

- [ ] **Mouse Moving:**
    - Allow users to move windows using the mouse.
